Changes Made in qa:
Adjusted the 'help' output by adding ' ' to help identify the in-game commands
Adjusted the 'buy plant' command. The specified plant is now one word instead of just two, such as sun flower to sunflower.

Known Issues:
When the lawn mover activates, all the tiles in the row filled up with 'x'. It should revert back to normal the next turn, but it doesn't.
